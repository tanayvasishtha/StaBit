## Overview
StaBit is a user-friendly and secure web application that enables seamless cross-chain swapping between Bitcoin (BTC) and Starknet assets (STRK, ETH, and others). Built with modern web technologies and integrated with Atomiq and Xverse APIs, StaBit simplifies the complex process of swapping assets across chains while providing real-time rates and transparent fees.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node 18+
- A Starknet wallet (Argent X or Braavos)

### Setup
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
VITE_DEFAULT_CHAIN=sepolia
# Optional future API keys
# VITE_ATOMIQ_API_KEY=
# VITE_XVERSE_PROJECT_ID=
```

### Wallets
- Use the Connect button (Argent/Braavos) in the top-right to connect your Starknet wallet. When swapping to a Starknet asset, your connected address auto-fills as the recipient.

### Rates/Quotes
- Currently uses a placeholder quote function in `src/lib/rates.ts`. Replace with Atomiq/Xverse quote endpoints for production.

## Future Plans
*   Expand token support to include more assets on both Bitcoin and Starknet.
*   Implement a transaction history feature for user accounts.
*   Integrate with additional DeFi protocols to source deeper liquidity.
*   Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android.

## Starknet ReSolve Hackathon
